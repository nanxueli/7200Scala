Description: 
The purpose of this assignment is to test your understanding of the material we went over this last week. This is classic functional programming material and I want you to feel comfortable with it.You have been asked to make the MiniDatabase code that we worked on in Assignment 1 more robust (no nulls, no empty strings, no exceptions). As usual the bare bones of the work is already available as MiniDatabase2.scala in the REPO under the edu.neu.coe.scala.minidatabase2 package. And there is specification file MiniDatabaseSpec2.scala in the same package under the test directory. The places where work is required are marked as TODOs (as you might expect in the real world!). Each TODO is marked with the number of points it is worth.These problems shouldn't challenge you to much if you remember Simple, Obvious, Elegant.
