Description: 
Not only will you be challenged in this assignment but you will learn something about my pet projects ;)
Mostly, you will get to demonstrate that you understand how to create a parser for fuzzy objects. But additionally, there are three tasks that require you to understand a little about the Fuzzy module and also the LazyNumber and LazyFunction modules.
Unlike the previous assignments, this one is taken from the Numerics project, also under the class repo parallel with FunctionalProgramming.
Here is the schedule of tasks from the Task tab in Eclipse.
TODO 3 marks	Fuzzy.scala	/Numerics/src/main/scala/edu/neu/coe/scala/numerics	line 197	Scala task		
TODO 35 marks:	FuzzyParser.scala	/Numerics/src/main/scala/edu/neu/coe/scala/parse	line 10	Scala task		
TODO 5 marks	Fuzzy.scala	/Numerics/src/main/scala/edu/neu/coe/scala/numerics	line 186	Scala task		
TODO 7 marks	LazyNumber.scala	/Numerics/src/main/scala/edu/neu/coe/scala/numerics	line 14	Scala task

The assignment carries a total of 50 marks. You may get help from anywhere you choose. I would suggest
•	my lecture notes
•	the FunctionalProgramming project
•	my blog
•	the Scala tutorials, and of course
•	StackOverflow.
You will need to run the unit tests (specifications) of course. If you run into a failure that doesn't appear to relate to the four code segments you are working on, then just let me know. But the only specifications that really matter are  FuzzyParserSpec, FuzzySpec and LazyNumberSpec.
The design of the Fuzzy, LazyNumber and LazyFunction modules is certainly not the last word on the subject. Indeed, I have a more up-to-date, better designed version but it's not ready for prime time.
Hopefully, you will be able to understand the workings of the three modules mentioned above simply by looking at them. In particular, I want you to take note of places where any implicit values and functions are defined. But I will talk some more about it during our next lecture.
